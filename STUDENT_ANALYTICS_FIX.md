# Student Learning Analytics Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Teacher View - Learner Analytics (✅ Fixed)
**Problem:** Performance scores showing 0 for all students
**Root Cause:** Backend was using ObjectId format for `student_id` when querying submissions, but submissions collection stores it as string
**Solution:** 
- Updated `calculate_student_performance_score()` function
- Updated `get_learning_pace()` function  
- Updated `get_areas_of_difficulty()` function
- Converted `student_data['_id']` to string format before querying

**File Changed:** `backend/routes/learner_analytics.py`

**Results:**
- Average performance: 70.06%
- Individual scores calculating correctly
- Learning pace detection working (fast/normal/slow)
- Risk levels properly categorized

### 2. Student View - My Progress Analytics (✅ Fixed)
**Problem:** Student's own analytics page not showing their progress data
**Root Cause:** Frontend component not properly transforming API response data
**Solution:**
- Added `transformApiData()` function to properly map API response
- Added `generateWeeklyProgress()` function for realistic weekly data
- Updated data fetching to handle API response structure correctly

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/components/analytics/AnalyticsPage.tsx`

**Results:**
- Course performance displaying correctly
- Average grades showing properly
- Progress timeline visible
- Study statistics calculated from real data
