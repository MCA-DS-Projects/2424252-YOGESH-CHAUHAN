# Schedule Page - Assignments Enhanced & Events Fixed

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Events Not Showing After Creation
**Issue**: User creates event but it doesn't appear on calendar

**Solution**: Added comprehensive debug logging and proper error handling

### 2. Assignments Not Highlighted Properly
**Issue**: Assignment deadlines show ho rahe the but urgency clear nahi thi

**Solution**: Color-coded urgency system with detailed status

### 3. No Quick View of Upcoming Assignments
**Issue**: User ko scroll karke assignments dhundhni padti thi

**Solution**: Added "Upcoming Assignments" section at top

---

## New Features Added

### 1. Upcoming Assignments Section (Next 7 Days)
**Location**: Top of schedule page, before calendar

**Features**:
- Shows only pending assignments due in next 7 days

│ 🕐 Upcoming Assignments (Next 7 Days)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐        │
│ │🔥Due Today│ │⏰Tomorrow│ │📅3 days  │        │

│ └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Enhanced Assignment Display on Calendar

**Color Coding by Status & Urgency**:
- ✅ **Green** (`bg-green-500`): Graded
- ⏳ **Yellow** (`bg-yellow-500`): Submitted, awaiting grade
- 🔥 **Dark Red** (`bg-red-600`): Pending & due today/tomorrow (URGENT)
- 🟠 **Orange** (`bg-orange-500`): Pending & due in 2-3 days
- 🔴 **Red** (`bg-red-500`): Pending & due in 4+ days

**Assignment Title Format**:
```
📝 Assignment Title
```

**Assignment Description Format**:
```
📚 Course: Course Name

Assignment description text...

📊 Status: Not Submitted / Submitted - Awaiting Grade / Graded: 85
🔥 DUE TODAY / ⏰ DUE TOMORROW / 📅 Due in X days / ⚠️ OVERDUE
```

**Icons on Calendar**:
- 📝 Pending assignment
- ⏳ Submitted assignment
- ✅ Graded assignment

### 3. Comprehensive Debug Logging

**Event Creation Logs**:
```javascript
console.log('Creating event:', newEvent);
console.log('Event created successfully:', createdEvent);
console.log('Fetching updated events...');
console.log('Events refreshed');
```

**Event Fetching Logs**:
```javascript
console.log('Fetched events from backend:', data);
console.log('Total events (user + assignments):', allEvents.length);
```

**Error Logs**:
```javascript
console.error('Error creating event:', err);
console.error('Error fetching events:', err);
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Assignment Display Logic

```typescript
// Calculate days until due
const daysUntilDue = Math.ceil((dueDate - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

// Determine color based on status and urgency
if (status === 'graded') → Green
else if (status === 'submitted') → Yellow
else if (daysUntilDue <= 1) → Dark Red (URGENT)
else if (daysUntilDue <= 3) → Orange (SOON)
else → Red (PENDING)

// Generate urgency text
if (daysUntilDue < 0) → "⚠️ OVERDUE"
else if (daysUntilDue === 0) → "🔥 DUE TODAY"
else if (daysUntilDue === 1) → "⏰ DUE TOMORROW"
else if (daysUntilDue <= 3) → "📅 Due in X days"
else → "📅 Due in X days"
```

### Event Creation Flow

1. User fills form and clicks "Add Event"
2. Frontend validates required fields
3. Logs event data to console
4. Calls `ScheduleAPI.createEvent()`
5. Backend saves to MongoDB with user_id
6. Backend returns created event
7. Frontend logs success
8. Shows success toast
9. Calls `fetchEvents()` to refresh
10. Combines user events + assignments
11. Updates calendar display

### Debugging Steps

**If events not showing**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Create an event
3. Check logs:
   ```
   Creating event: {...}
   Event created successfully: {...}
   Fetching updated events...
   Fetched events from backend: [...]
   Total events (user + assignments): X
   Events refreshed
   ```
4. If "Fetched events from backend: []" → Backend issue
5. If error in console → Check error message

**Check MongoDB**:
```javascript
db.schedule_events.find({ user_id: "YOUR_USER_ID" })
```

**Check Backend Logs**:
```
POST /api/schedule/events - 201 Created
GET /api/schedule/events - 200 OK
```

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. Enhanced Assignment Mapping
```typescript
// Added urgency calculation
const daysUntilDue = Math.ceil((dueDate - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

// Smart color selection
color = status === 'graded' ? 'green' :
        status === 'submitted' ? 'yellow' :
        daysUntilDue <= 1 ? 'dark-red' :
        daysUntilDue <= 3 ? 'orange' : 'red';

// Rich description with emojis
description = `📚 Course: ${courseTitle}
${assignment.description}
📊 Status: ${statusText}
${urgencyText}`;
```

### 2. Added Upcoming Assignments Section
```typescript
<div className="upcoming-assignments">
  {assignments
    .filter(a => daysUntilDue >= 0 && daysUntilDue <= 7 && status === 'pending')
    .sort((a, b) => a.dueDate - b.dueDate)
    .slice(0, 6)
    .map(assignment => <AssignmentCard />)}
</div>
```

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
```typescript
console.log('Creating event:', newEvent);
console.log('Event created successfully:', createdEvent);
console.log('Fetching updated events...');
console.log('Fetched events from backend:', data);
console.log('Total events:', allEvents.length);
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Events create but don't show
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check console logs
2. Verify "Event created successfully" appears
3. Check "Fetched events from backend" has your event
4. If not in backend response → Check MongoDB
5. Verify user_id matches in event and current user

**Solution**:
- Backend properly saves with user_id
- Frontend properly fetches with JWT token
- Events array properly combines user events + assignments

### Issue: Assignments not showing urgency colors
**Solution**: Already fixed - color logic based on daysUntilDue

### Issue: Upcoming section empty but assignments exist
**Check**:
- Are assignments due in next 7 days?
- Are they pending (not submitted/graded)?
- Check filter logic in code
