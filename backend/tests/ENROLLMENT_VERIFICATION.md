# Enrollment and Access Control Verification

## Task 13: Fix student course enrollment and access

This document verifies that all requirements for Task 13 have been implemented and tested.

### Requirements Verification

#### Requirement 5.4: Enrollment Record Creation
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Implementation:**
- Location: `backend/routes/courses.py` - `enroll_course()` function (lines 380-450)
- Creates enrollment record with all required fields:
  - `student_id`: Links to the student
  - `course_id`: Links to the course
  - `enrolled_at`: Timestamp of enrollment
  - `progress`: Initial progress (0)
  - `completed_materials`: Empty array initially
  - `completed_assignments`: Empty array initially
  - `is_active`: Set to True

**Tests:**
- Property test: `test_property_26_enrollment_record_creation` in `test_enrollment_properties.py`
  - Runs 100 iterations with random student/course IDs
  - Verifies enrollment record creation
  - Verifies all required fields are present
  - Status: ✅ PASSED
  
- Integration test: `test_enrollment_record_creation_integration` in `test_enrollment_integration.py`
  - Tests actual API endpoint `/api/courses/<course_id>/enroll`
  - Verifies database record creation
  - Status: ✅ PASSED

#### Requirement 6.3: Unauthorized Access Rejection
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Implementation:**

1. **Video Access Control**
   - Location: `backend/routes/videos.py` - `stream_video()` function (lines 160-240)
   - Checks enrollment before serving video:
   ```python
   enrollment = db.enrollments.find_one({
       'student_id': user_id,
       'course_id': course_id
   })
   if not enrollment:
       return jsonify({'error': 'You must be enrolled in this course to access this video'}), 403
   ```

2. **Document Access Control**
   - Location: `backend/routes/documents.py` - `serve_document()` function (lines 109-200)
   - Checks enrollment before serving document:
   ```python
   enrollment = db.enrollments.find_one({
       'course_id': course_id,
       'student_id': user_id
   })
   if not enrollment:
       return jsonify({'error': 'Access denied. You must be enrolled in this course.'}), 403
   ```

3. **Course Detail Access Control**
   - Location: `backend/routes/courses.py` - `get_course()` function (lines 160-240)
   - Checks enrollment for private courses:
   ```python
   if user['role'] == 'student':
       enrollment = db.enrollments.find_one({
           'course_id': course_id,
           'student_id': user_id
       })
       if not enrollment and not course.get('is_public', False):
           return jsonify({'error': 'Access denied'}), 403
   ```

**Tests:**
- Property test: `test_property_32_unauthorized_access_rejection` in `test_enrollment_properties.py`
  - Runs 100 iterations with random enrollment states
  - Verifies 403 status for unenrolled students
  - Verifies 200 status for enrolled students
  - Status: ✅ PASSED
  
- Integration test: `test_unauthorized_access_rejection_integration` in `test_enrollment_integration.py`
  - Tests actual video streaming endpoint
  - Verifies 403 for unenrolled students
  - Status: ✅ PASSED

#### Display Enrolled Courses on Student Dashboard
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Implementation:**
- Location: `backend/routes/courses.py` - `get_courses()` function (lines 40-160)
- For students, adds enrollment information to each course:
```python
if user['role'] == 'student':
    enrollment = db.enrollments.find_one({
        'course_id': str(course['_id']),
        'student_id': user_id
    })
    course['is_enrolled'] = enrollment is not None
    if enrollment:
        course['enrollment_date'] = enrollment['enrolled_at']
        course['progress'] = enrollment.get('progress', 0)
```

**Frontend Integration:**
- The `is_enrolled` flag is used by the frontend to:
  - Display enrollment status
  - Show/hide enrollment buttons
  - Display progress information
  - Control access to course materials

### Summary

All requirements for Task 13 have been successfully implemented and verified:

1. ✅ Enrollment record creation works correctly with all required fields
2. ✅ Enrollment checks are in place for all course material access (videos, documents, course details)
3. ✅ 403 Forbidden errors are returned for unauthorized access attempts
4. ✅ Enrolled courses are properly displayed on student dashboard with enrollment metadata

### Test Results

**Property-Based Tests:**
- `test_property_26_enrollment_record_creation`: ✅ PASSED (100 iterations)
- `test_property_32_unauthorized_access_rejection`: ✅ PASSED (100 iterations)
- `test_property_multiple_students_enrollment`: ✅ PASSED (100 iterations)

**Integration Tests:**
- `test_enrollment_record_creation_integration`: ✅ PASSED
- `test_unauthorized_access_rejection_integration`: ✅ PASSED

**Total Tests:** 5 tests, 5 passed, 0 failed

### Correctness Properties Validated

- **Property 26:** For any student enrollment in a course, an enrollment record should exist in the database linking the student to the course. ✅ VALIDATED
- **Property 32:** For any student attempting to access a course they are not enrolled in, the system should return a 403 Forbidden error. ✅ VALIDATED

### Implementation Quality

The implementation follows best practices:
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Clear error messages for users
- Proper database indexing on enrollment queries
- Atomic operations for enrollment creation
- Proper cleanup on unenrollment
- Notification system integration for enrollment events

### Conclusion

Task 13 is complete. The enrollment and access control system is fully functional, properly tested, and meets all specified requirements.
