## Known Remaining Issues

### ⚠️ Course ID Undefined Issue
**Symptoms:**
- `/api/courses/undefined` errors
- `/api/progress/course/undefined` errors
- Video stats not loading
- "Endpoint not found" errors

**Root Cause:**
- Course objects inconsistently using `_id` vs `id`
- Some components expecting `courseId` prop but receiving undefined

**Affected Components:**
- CourseDetailPage
- CourseVideosView
- TeacherDashboard

**Solution Needed:**
Normalize course ID field across all components. Ensure:
1. Backend always returns `_id`
2. Frontend transforms to `id` consistently
3. All components check both fields as fallback
