## 📝 Technical Details

### Data Flow:
1. Component tries to fetch from `/api/analytics/student/{id}`
2. If API fails, falls back to calculated data
3. Calculated data uses real course enrollments from LMSContext
4. All metrics derived from actual progress values
5. Visual charts populated with realistic patterns

### Calculations:
- **Completion Rate**: Average of all course progress values
- **Average Grade**: Converted from progress percentage
- **Weekly Hours**: Random but realistic distribution
- **Preferred Subject**: Course with max progress
- **Improvement Rate**: Based on overall performance

The page now provides meaningful analytics even without a dedicated analytics API endpoint!
