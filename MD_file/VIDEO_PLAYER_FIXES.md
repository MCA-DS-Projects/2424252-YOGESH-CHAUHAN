# Video Player Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Video Streaming Error (500 Internal Server Error)
**Problem**: The `file_path` variable was being used in logging before it was defined, causing a 500 error when trying to stream videos.

**Location**: `backend/routes/videos.py` - `/stream` endpoint

**Fix**: Moved the `file_path = video.get('file_path')` line to execute before it's used in logging.

```python
# Before: file_path used before being defined
log_file_access(user_id=user_id, file_path=file_path, ...)  # ERROR!
file_path = video.get('file_path')  # Defined too late

# After: file_path defined first
file_path = video.get('file_path')  # Defined first
log_file_access(user_id=user_id, file_path=file_path if file_path else video_id, ...)
```

### 2. Undefined Video ID Error
**Problem**: Videos were being passed with `undefined` as the video ID, causing the frontend to request `/api/videos/undefined/stream`.

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/courses/CourseDetailPage.tsx`

**Root Cause**: The material transformation was using `material.content` as the ID, but for some videos this field was empty or not properly set.

**Fix**: 
1. Added explicit `videoId` field to the material interface
2. Updated material transformation to set `videoId` properly with fallbacks:
   ```typescript
   videoId: material.content || material._id
   ```
3. Updated the video player button to use the correct ID:
   ```typescript
   onClick={() => setSelectedVideo({ 
     id: material.videoId || material.contentId || material.id,
     title: material.title,
     youtubeUrl: material.youtubeUrl 
   })}
   ```

### 3. React Key Prop Warning
**Problem**: Console warning about missing "key" prop in list rendering.

**Status**: The code already has proper keys on all mapped elements. This warning may have been from a previous state or will resolve after the other fixes are applied.

### 4. 401 Unauthorized Errors on Progress Endpoint
**Problem**: Multiple 401 errors when trying to fetch course progress.

**Likely Cause**: Authentication token issues or the progress endpoint requiring proper enrollment verification.

**Note**: This needs to be monitored after the video streaming fixes are applied. The progress endpoint should work if the user is properly enrolled in the course.

## Files Modified

1. `backend/routes/videos.py` - Fixed video streaming endpoint
2. `frontend/src/components/courses/CourseDetailPage.tsx` - Fixed video ID handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Video Playback**:
   - Click on a video in a course
   - Verify the video loads without 500 errors
   - Check that the correct video ID is being used in the network request

2. **Test Progress Tracking**:
   - Watch a video for a few seconds
   - Close the video player
   - Verify progress is saved (check network tab for successful progress API calls)

3. **Test YouTube Videos**:
   - If any courses have YouTube videos, verify they still work correctly
   - Check that the `youtubeUrl` field is properly passed to the VideoPlayer

4. **Test Enrollment**:
   - Ensure students can only access videos from courses they're enrolled in
   - Verify 403 errors are returned for unauthorized access (not 500 errors)

## Additional Notes

- The video streaming endpoint now properly handles missing file paths
- Video IDs are now consistently tracked through the material transformation pipeline
- Both local videos and YouTube videos should work correctly
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing data structures
