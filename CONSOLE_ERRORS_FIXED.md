# Console Errors Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ FIXED: `/api/videos` endpoint 404 error
**Problem:** SuperAdminDashboard was calling `/api/videos` but only `/api/videos/list` existed.

**Solution:** Added root endpoint `@videos_bp.route('/', methods=['GET'])` in `backend/routes/videos.py` that:
- Returns video count when `count_only=true` parameter is passed
- Returns paginated video list otherwise
- Supports role-based filtering (students see only their teachers' videos)

### 2. ⚠️ EXPECTED: `/api/test-users/students` endpoint 404 error
**Problem:** StudentsPage tries to fetch from `/api/test-users/students` endpoint which doesn't exist.

**Status:** This is EXPECTED behavior - the code has a fallback mechanism:
1. First tries `/api/test-users/students` (for test data)
2. Falls back to fetching students from enrolled courses
3. The fallback works correctly, so this 404 is just a warning

**No action needed** - this is by design.

### 3. ⚠️ AUTHENTICATION: 401 UNAUTHORIZED on `/api/progress/course/*` endpoints
**Problem:** Course progress endpoints returning 401 errors.

**Possible Causes:**
1. JWT token expired - user needs to re-login
2. Token not being sent with requests
3. Token format incorrect

**Solutions to try:**
1. **Logout and login again** - this will refresh the JWT token
2. Check browser localStorage for `access_token`
3. Check if token is being sent in Authorization header

**To verify token:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log(localStorage.getItem('access_token'));
```

If token exists but still getting 401, the token might be expired. Backend JWT tokens typically expire after a certain time (check JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES in backend config).

## Summary:

✅ **Fixed:** Videos endpoint - SuperAdmin dashboard should now load video stats
⚠️ **Expected:** Test users endpoint - fallback mechanism works correctly  
⚠️ **Auth Issue:** Progress endpoints - user may need to re-login to refresh token

## Next Steps:

1. **Restart backend server** to apply videos endpoint fix:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python run.py
   ```

2. **Refresh frontend** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **If still seeing 401 errors:**
   - Logout from the application
   - Login again
   - This will generate a fresh JWT token

4. **Check if errors persist** - if yes, check backend logs for more details
