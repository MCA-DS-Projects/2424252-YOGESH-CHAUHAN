# Super Admin Dashboard - Enhanced Version

## Problem Fixed
Admin login ke baad purana student dashboard dikh raha tha instead of Super Admin Dashboard.

### Root Cause
- Admin user ka role `admin` tha
- Dashboard component sirf `super_admin` role ke liye SuperAdminDashboard render kar raha tha
- `admin` role default case mein fall through ho raha tha aur StudentDashboard show ho raha tha

### Solution Applied
Updated `Dashboard.tsx` to render SuperAdminDashboard for both `admin` and `super_admin` roles.
